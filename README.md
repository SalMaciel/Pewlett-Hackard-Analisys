## Summary
Based on the results we can conlcude that there are over 72000 positions that will need to be filled and there is enough retirement ready personnel to mentor the new generation of employees.
It's worth mentioning that there are only 2 managers retiring and almost 26000 senior engineers, filling up the senior engineers spots will be far more challenging than the manager's.
